## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Role |
|------------|------|
| `HTML5`    | Markup for structure |
| `CSS3`     | Styling and layout (Flexbox, transitions) |
| `JavaScript ` | Dynamic rendering, modal handling, filtering |
| `React`   | Can be integrated for scalability and better state management |

## 🧠 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation and rendering components dynamically
- Managing state-like behavior in vanilla JS (filtering, modals)
- Avoiding layout reflow and glitches with `position: absolute/fixed`
- Responsive design and mobile-first layout
- Enhancing UX with animations, transitions, and visual feedback

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- ✍️ Add a markdown-based blog engine or CMS integration (e.g. Contentful, Firebase)
- 🌓 Dark/Light mode toggle
- 🗣️ Commenting system for blog posts
- ⚛️ Convert to React for better modularity and routing
